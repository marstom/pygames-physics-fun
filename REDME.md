To accelerate a sprite in Pygame using Vector2, you can follow these steps:

1. Import the necessary modules:

```python
import pygame
from pygame.math import Vector2
```

2. Create a `Vector2` object to represent the acceleration. This vector should have a magnitude (length) representing the amount of acceleration you want to apply, and a direction representing the direction you want the sprite to accelerate in. For example, to accelerate the sprite horizontally to the right, you can create a vector like this:

```python
acceleration = Vector2(0.5, 0)
```

This creates a vector with a magnitude of 0.5 in the x direction (to the right) and 0 in the y direction.

3. Create a `Vector2` object to represent the sprite's velocity. This vector should start at zero, since the sprite is initially stationary.

```python
velocity = Vector2(0, 0)
```

4. In your game loop, update the velocity vector by adding the acceleration vector to it:

```python
velocity += acceleration
```

5. Update the sprite's position using its velocity:

```python
sprite.rect.x += velocity.x
sprite.rect.y += velocity.y
```

This will move the sprite by its x and y velocity components.

Here's an example of how you could use these steps to move a sprite horizontally to the right with an acceleration of 0.5:

```python
import pygame
from pygame.math import Vector2

pygame.init()
screen = pygame.display.set_mode((640, 480))
clock = pygame.time.Clock()

class Player(pygame.sprite.Sprite):
    def __init__(self, x, y):
        super().__init__()
        self.image = pygame.Surface((50, 50))
        self.image.fill((255, 255, 255))
        self.rect = self.image.get_rect()
        self.rect.x = x
        self.rect.y = y

player = Player(50, 50)
acceleration = Vector2(0.5, 0)
velocity = Vector2(0, 0)

while True:
    for event in pygame.event.get():
        if event.type == pygame.QUIT:
            pygame.quit()
            sys.exit()

    velocity += acceleration
    player.rect.x += velocity.x

    screen.fill((0, 0, 0))
    screen.blit(player.image, player.rect)
    pygame.display.flip()

    clock.tick(60)
```

This will move the player sprite to the right with an acceleration of 0.5 pixels per frame per frame, until it reaches the edge of the screen. You can modify the acceleration vector and the starting position of the sprite to experiment with different movements.
